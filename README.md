# Sharetic
An online open source formation platform (MOOC-like) for Junior-Enterprises.

**Frontend** : Angular 4 (Typescript/Javascript framework)

**Backend** : Symfony 2 (PHP framework)

## Structure

This project is splitted into two repositories (Frontend and Backend) :
- This repo (**ShareticCLIENT**) contains the source code of the Angular application.
- The repo [**ShareticREST**](https://github.com/ETICINSATechnologies/ShareticREST) contains the source code of the Symfony application (as a RESTful API).

They can be deployed on two different servers, just edit the config files if needed.

## ETIC INSA Technologies
This project is initiated by the Computer and Information Systems team of INSA Lyon's Junior-Enterprise.
